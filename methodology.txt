The hacking methodology categories align with the enterprise attack tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK matrix. The categories are:
Initial access - Gaining initial entry to the target network, usually involving password-guessing, exploits, or phishing emails
Execution - Launching attacker tools and malicious code, including RATs and backdoors
Persistence - Creating autostart extensibility points (ASEPs) to remain active and survive system restarts
Privilege escalation - Obtaining higher permission levels for code by running it in the context of a privileged process or account
Defense evasion - Avoiding security controls by, for example, turning off security apps, deleting implants, and running rootkits
Credential access - Obtaining valid credentials to extend control over devices and other resources in the network
Discovery - Gathering information about important devices and resources, such as administrator computers, domain controllers, and file servers
Lateral movement - Moving between devices in the target network to reach critical resources or gain network persistence
Collection - Locating and collecting data for exfiltration
Command and control - Connecting to attacker-controlled network infrastructure to relay data or receive commands
Exfiltration - Extracting data from the network to an external, attacker-controlled location
